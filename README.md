# Python_KSK_Validation
<h3>This project will minimize failures and maximize seamless production within our plant by continues order validations for all sales order (configuration check).</h3>
<p>By validating every sales order against the defined and agreed KSK (Kundenspezifischer Kabelbaum, this translates to custom wiring harness) documentation. To guaranty 100% quality (for the wiring harness configuration) all the sales orders have to passthrough a series of validations. Every day, every sales order will be validated, and when a sales order fails at least one of these validations, it will be marked as an incorrect configured order (done by a follow-up application) and these will be unable to be planned. This will guaranty seamless production.</p>
<p>In a nutshell the validations exists out of:
  <ul>
    <li>Missing step validation</li>
    <li>Multiple step validation</li>
    <li>BOM (= Bill Of Material) vs documentation validation</li>
  </ul>
</p>
